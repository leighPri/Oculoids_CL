Jeffy will look back on this in about five years and cringe. The guy in the back is recalling his own awkward teenage phase."

I wouldn’t go so far as to call this an outright pet peeve as it doesn’t REALLY annoy me, but it is weird to parse words in your head this way because people don’t think about it when typing. The exceptions are consonants that can be stressed (like N, M, F, or S)."
